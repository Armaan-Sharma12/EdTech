# 🧠 EdTech AI Assessment Engine

This project is an **AI-powered adaptive learning platform** designed to enhance education through intelligent question analysis and generation. It uses the **Cohere API** to classify difficulty levels, generate new questions, and explain answers, forming a robust backend for EdTech applications.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Difficulty Classification** of questions using Cohere embeddings
- ✍️ **Question Generation** for dynamic quizzes
- 💡 **Answer Explanation** to support student learning
- 🧠 **Adaptive Engine** for personalized question delivery
- 📄 JSON-based question datasets for Science subjects

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/edtech-ai-engine.git
cd edtech-ai-engine
```

### 2. Setup Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add your Cohere API Key

Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory:

```bash
COHERE_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

Get your key from Cohere Dashboard.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

This will test the full pipeline (load questions, classify difficulty, and explain answers).

## Example Use Cases

1. ```difficulty_classifier.py``` → Classifies how hard a question is
2. ```question_generator.py``` → Generates new science-based questions
3. ```answer_explainer.py``` → Generates a simplified explanation of the correct answer
4. ```adaptive_engine.py``` → Selects the next best question based on student progress

## Dependencies

1. ```cohere```
2. ```python-dotenv```
3. ```pandas```
4. ```json```
5. ```os```

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

1. All Cohere logic is modularized in ```cohere_ai/``` for reusability.
2. Dataset uses cleaned and tagged science questions.
3. Ready for integration with Streamlit, Flask, or any frontend.
